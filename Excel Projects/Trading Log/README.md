# Trading Log

* Overview: This trading log helps traders keep a track about their day-to-day trading and the current trade they are doing (or thinking about doing), this historical data can then be used to extract insights whether to take a trade or not to take it.

* Background: Unconsciously (Ignoring the existence of this field), this was my first step into the data analysis, I am a very organized person therefore if I have the goal of starting (or help someone to start) into a subject that can be quantified it must be through the use of data. I started this project while knowing absolutely nothing about excel but that didn't stop me, I thought about what and how to reflect, created a plan and then searched how to complete the tasks I assigned myself to do.

* IF, Counts, Macros, Lists, Tables, Sheet-to-sheet, Converter, etc.
