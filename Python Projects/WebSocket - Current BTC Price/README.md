# WebSocket - Current BTC Price

* Overview: Using the WebSocket library, created a connection to retrieve BTC price from the exchange Coinbase

* Background: Exploring the API and WebSocket I found ways to POST, REQUEST and DELETE everything about trading, this is one of the useful functions that I used to elaborate my own trading algorithms, WebSocket is faster than using the API so I chose to use this approach, getting the price is the first step in order to build a trading algorithm.

* API, WebSocket
