# Intro to Python for Beginners

* Overview: A guide that contains the most used packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, example of a class, keywords, functions and datasets to practice

* Background: My best and favorite project so far, not because of it's complexity but because how useful it has been for me and how it represents me. It's organized, it's helpful, It was made as a plan for the future, it's always there for when you need to check into a syntax that you might have forgotten (quicker than using stackoverflow), always updating it with new important functions

* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Datasets, Keywords, Functions, Classes
